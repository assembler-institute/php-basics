# PHP Basics

The main objective of this project is to learn the basics of PHP as well as how a server-side-language works. In particular, this work will be represented as a library of functionalities which will display different features of PHP such as print, iterators, operators, dates, conditionals, types, maths, strings, arrays, functions, and phpinfo.

## Getting Started

- Install a code editor to help me writing my code. The code editor I have been using is VS Code.
