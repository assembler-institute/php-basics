# INTRODUCTION

> In this project we started getting used to simple php sintax. We got to work with the typical programming basics but
this time with the php language. 

Why was it useful:

- To be able to separate php and javascript sintax in our minds.
- To have the sufficient ease of use to get us ready for starter projects.
- To learn to be carful with our code because of increased debugging dificulty.


## Requirements

- Learn the basics to program in PHP.
- Understand what a server-side language is and what it is used for.

## Result

A small library of functions and methods to get things done in php. It will be a useful repository to check in the 
future when coding php and to review its different possibilities.
