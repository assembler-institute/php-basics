# PHP-Basics

First steps in PHP. Creating a directory with the different methods and nomenclature of PHP.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Having an environment capable of running PHP in a version higher than 7.2.

### Installing

Install PHP environment. PHP is widely used to develop with a XAMPP environment which is basically a stack of web technologies such as web server, php interpreter and a MariaDB database.

Since PHP is designed for the web it requires a web server. So to give an easier approach to install all these services at once and across Linux, Mac and Windows operating systems the Apache Friends created XAMPP.
