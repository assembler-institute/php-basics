# PHP Basics - Assambler proejct

This is a project pill given as a task in Assembler institute of Technology. In this project we examine the notions of the famous PHP language which is so used in the world of web development.

## Getting Started

There's not too much to it, just make sure your machine is supporting a php development environment, if not you can download any of your favourite integrated development environment software such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) if you are using Windows OS.


### Installing

After cloning make sure you copy all the files into htdocs in your local machine so you can see the output in your browser.
Run your localhost and then the relative path of the file, for example:



```
http://localhost:8080/arrays.php
```

or

```
http://localhost:8080/functions.php
```
